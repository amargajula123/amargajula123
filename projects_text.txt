# Project 1 :🏡 MLOps - California House Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases an **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** for predicting California house prices using multiple regression algorithms.  
The system automatically selects the **best-performing model** based on the evaluation metrics defined in a config file.

The aim is to demonstrate **modular, configurable, and scalable ML workflows** using Python and MLOps best practices.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Multiple regression algorithms defined in `config.yaml`
- Automatic best model selection
- Data preprocessing and transformation
- Train/test split using Stratified Sampling
- API deployment using Flask
- Model monitoring with Evidently
- Modular and scalable code structure

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages/Libraries:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyYAML
- **Frameworks:** Flask
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **MLOps Tools:** Evidently
- **Dev Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git/GitHub

## 🔧 How It Works
- Read algorithm list from `config.yaml`
- Perform EDA, feature engineering, and scaling
- Train multiple models and evaluate them
- Select and save the best-performing model
- Serve predictions via Flask API
- Track model drift using Evidently

# Project 2:🗃️ Distributed Database Access System  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Gateway-based access to multiple Databases**, such as **MongoDB** and **MySQL**, through a single unified API interface using Flask.

The main objective is to **enable seamless communication between client applications and multiple database systems** through a centralized gateway, improving flexibility, scalability, and modularity.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Access multiple databases (e.g., MongoDB and MySQL) via a single gateway
- Modular design to add more databases in the future
- Tested using Postman

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Flask
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL
- **Libraries:** `flask`, `requests`, `jsonify`
## 🧰 Tools
- VS Code / PyCharm  
- Postman  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git

## 🔧 How It Works
- A Flask-based API acts as a **gateway**.
- Depending on the requests it **routes** operations to the correct **underlying database** (MySQL or MongoDB).
- Responses are handled and returned in JSON format.
