# Distributed Database Access System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Gateway-based access to multiple Databases**, such as **MongoDB** and **MySQL**, through a single unified API interface using Flask.

The main objective is to **enable seamless communication between client applications and multiple database systems** through a centralized gateway, improving flexibility, scalability, and modularity.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Access multiple databases (e.g., MongoDB and MySQL) via a single gateway
- Modular design to add more databases in the future
- Tested using Postman

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Flask
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL
- **Libraries:** `flask`, `requests`, `jsonify`
## 🧰 Tools
- VS Code / PyCharm  
- Postman  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git

## 🔧 How It Works
- A Flask-based API acts as a **gateway**.
- Depending on the requests it **routes** operations to the correct **underlying database** (MySQL or MongoDB).
- Responses are handled and returned in JSON format.
